官方提到他们不打算提供二进制文件，所以需要去Visual Studio里自己编译
--“We are not planning on releasing binaries for Certify, so you will have to compile yourself :)

Certify has been built against .NET 4.0 and is compatible with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. Simply open up the project .sln, choose "Release", and build.”
